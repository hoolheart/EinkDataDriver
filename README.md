# Eink Data Driver

The objective of this project is to construct a C++ toolbox for manipulating data. In other words, this is a data-driven toolkit.

### Note on May 14th, 2013

The basic functions this project plans to support are as follows:

* Algebra operations for vectors and matrices;
* Curve fitting and interpolation;
* Convex optimization;
* Statistics;
* Artificial intelligent algorithms.

### Restart on May 8th, 2014

About eight months later, I gonna restart this project from today on. By comparing the plan a year ago, only the first two tasks were achieved. The rest three are more difficult and they are the focus of the next works.

Pray for good luck.
